For this project I used results from the 2019 and 2020 CrossFit Opens to build a simulation model and forecast Stage 1 of the 2020 CrossFit games.

The format for Stage 1 of the 2020 CrossFit games is very similar to that of the Open.  I expect athletes who perform well in the Open to score well in this competition.
